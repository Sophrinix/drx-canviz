== Misc

* The 'Colored' module: we can't open in editor most of its methods.

* eval() in the context of the "tip" object, not the selected one.

* Clicking an empty listbox results in error.

* get_diagram(): would be cleaner if it gets the 'files' as an argument. Tempfiles' constructor should get a block and clean after itself.

* Switching back to the app from the editor unselects the object: because CTRL is pressed...

* 'drxtk.rb' emits warnings with '-w'. That probably isn't my fault.

* Make sure the C extension compiles in C++ mode. And get rid of that warning.

* Cleanups:
  - '@stack' not descriptive
  - DrxWindow -> Application
  - Are the ::TkListbox tweakings neccesary?
  - Move layout classes down

== Bugs

Nothing noteworthy, I think.
