== Misc

* The 'Colored' module: we can't open in editor most of its methods.

* Write a "frames" layout manager. It's tedious to use gazilions of TkFrames/TkPanedwindows.

* get_diagram(): would be cleaner if it gets the 'files' as an argument. Tempfiles' constructor should get a block and clean after itself.

* Switching back to the app from the editor unselects the object: because CTRL is pressed...

* Drx::* --> Drx::Core::*

* 'drxtk.rb' emits warnings with '-w'. That probably isn't my fault.

* Make sure the C extension compiles in C++ mode. And get rid of that warning.

== Features

* Have a textarea where output from eval()/p()/etc goes.

== Bugs

Nothing noteworthy, I think.
