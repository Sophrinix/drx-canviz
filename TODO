== Misc

* The 'Colored' module: we can't open in editor most of its methods.

* Switching back to the app from the editor unselects the object: because CTRL is pressed...

* Drx::* --> Drx::Core::*

* 'drxtk.rb' emits warnings with '-w'. That probably isn't my fault.

* Make sure the C extension compiles in C++ mode. And get rid of that warning.

== Bugs

Nothing noteworthy, I think.
